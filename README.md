Olle & Maija Portfolio
======================

## About
myFlaskProject is a template-based webserver created by Olle KvarnstrÃ¶m and Maija Vilkinia.
Our goal is to provide a simple-to-use webserver for users who may not have much experience with HTML.

Installation
------------
There are two dependencies for myFlaskProject: Python (version 3.3.2 or higher) and Flask.
Since we recommend running Flask inside virtualenv, we've included it in our instructions.
### Windows
**NOTE: Support for the Windows operating systems is experimental at best! Please use Mac OS X or Linux instead!**
**Step1: Installing Python and VirtualEnv**
> Download and install Python from this [link](http://python.org/download/). Please install it to C:\Python33 as is the default.
> Download and extract VirtualEnv, which can be found here: [link](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
> Open up Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted VirtualEnv
> Type the following and press enter: `C:\Python33\python.exe setup.py install`
> Now you have installed both Python And VirtualEnv. If you like you can remove the extracted folder.

**Step 2: Fetch the newest myFlaskProject build**
> Download the latest version of myFlaskProject through this [link](http://gitlab.ida.liu.se/ip-arbeten-2013/tdp003/repository/archive) (requires a valid LiU-ID).
> Extract the contents to a suitable location (choose a location wisely, as moving it later might cause issues).
> Open up Command Prompt and navigate to the newly extracted folder, then open tdp003. Here we will initialise a virtual environment, so please run the following command:
> `C:\Python33\python.exe -m virtualenv venv`
> This will create a new virtual environment which you will need to "activate" every time before starting of stopping myFlaskProject.
> Activating is done by typing this: (please do so now)
> `venv\scripts\activate`
> Now, the last step is installing Flask, type the following:
> `pip install flask`

### Mac OS X
*Step1: Installing Python and VirtualEnv**
> Download and install Python from this [link](http://python.org/download/).
> Download and extract VirtualEnv, which can be found here: [link](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
> Open up a terminal (if you have not already) and navigate to the folder where you extracted VirtualEnv
> Type the following and press enter
> `sudo python3 setup.py install`
> Now you have installed both Python And VirtualEnv. If you like you can remove the extracted folder.

**Step 2: Fetch the newest myFlaskProject build**
> Download the latest version of myFlaskProject through this [link](http://gitlab.ida.liu.se/ip-arbeten-2013/tdp003/repository/archive) (requires a valid LiU-ID).
> Extract the contents to a suitable location (choose a location wisely, as moving it later might cause issues).
> Open up a terminal (if you haven't done so already) and move to the extracted folder, then tdp003. Here we will initialise a virtual environment, so please run the following command: 
> `virtualenv venv`
> This will create a new virtual environment which you need to "activate" every time before starting or stopping myFlaskProject.
> Activating is done by typing this: (please do so now)
> `. venv/bin/activate`
> Now, the last step, is installing Flask
> `pip install flask`

### Linux
**Step 1: Install Python and VirtualEnv**
> If you have Debian/Ubuntu or similar, run this in your terminal:
> `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3 virtualenv`
> If you have Fedora/RHEL or similar, run this in your terminal:
> `yum install python3 virtualenv`
> If you have Slackware, there are slackbuilds [here](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/python/python3/) and [here](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/python/virtualenv/).

**Step 2: Fetch the newest myFlaskProject build**
> Download the latest version of myFlaskProject through this [link](http://gitlab.ida.liu.se/ip-arbeten-2013/tdp003/repository/archive) (requires a valid LiU-ID).
> Extract the contents to a suitable location (choose a location wisely, as moving it later might cause issues).
> Open up a terminal (if you haven't done so already) and move to the extracted folder, then tdp003. Here we will initialise a virtual environment, so please run the following command: 
> `virtualenv venv`
> This will create a new virtual environment which you need to "activate" every time before starting or stopping myFlaskProject.
> Activating is done by typing this: (please do so now)
> `. venv/bin/activate`
> Now, the last step, is installing Flask
> `pip install flask`

## Managing the application
To start or stop the webserver you will first need to open up a terminal and navigate to the folder where you installed myFlaskProject.
Now you will need to activate the virtual environment. You do this by running the following command:
`. venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\scripts\activate` if using Windows)
Now you can simply run the myFlaskProject.py and the start/stop argument. E.g:
`web/myFlaskProject.py start`
`web/myFlaskProject.py stop`

The application will create a log-file in the tdp003-directory, which will record all access to the webserver. If any errors happen they will be logged there as well.
Please do not modify the log-file while myFlaskProject is running, as doing so may cause it to stop logging and/or to shut down.

You may also notice a file named "pid". Please keep your paws off this file as it tracks the running process ID.
