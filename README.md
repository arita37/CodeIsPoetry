======================

## About
myFlaskProject is a template-based webserver created by Olle KvarnstrÃÃÂ¶m and Maija Vilkinia.
Our goal is to provide a simple-to-use webserver for users who may not have much experience with HTML.

Installation
------------
There are two dependencies for myFlaskProject: Python (version 3.3.2 or higher) and Flask.
Since we recommend running Flask inside virtualenv, we've included it in our instructions.

### Linux
**Step 1: Install Python and VirtualEnv**
> If you have Debian/Ubuntu or similar, run this in your terminal:
> `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3 virtualenv`
> If you have Fedora/RHEL or similar, run this in your terminal:
> `yum install python3 virtualenv`
> If you have Slackware, there are slackbuilds [here](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/python/python3/) and [here](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/python/virtualenv/).

**Step 2: Fetch the newest myFlaskProject build**
> Download the latest version of myFlaskProject through this [link](http://gitlab.ida.liu.se/ip-arbeten-2013/tdp003/repository/archive) (requires a valid LiU-ID).
> Extract the contents to a suitable location (choose a location wisely, as moving it later might cause issues).
> Open up a terminal (if you haven't done so already) and move to the extracted folder. Here we will initialise a virtual environment, so please run the following command: 
> `virtualenv venv`
> This will create a new virtual environment which you need to "activate" every time before starting or stopping myFlaskProject.
Activating is done by typing this: (please do so now)
> `. venv/bin/activate`
Now, the last step, is installing Flask
> `pip install flask`
